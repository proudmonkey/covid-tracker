# COVID-19 Status Tracker

With the current pandemic that we are experiencing, I find it inconvenient to get the latest case updates regarding COVID-19 globally and locally here in MN where we currently live. Social media info are most of the time outdated, inaccurate and other bogus websites presenting nonsense information. So I have decided to create a simple web app that gives us the core information in a glance without having to lurk the internet that works in both mobile and web browsers. The data used in the app are based on the main sources of information regarding COVID cases: [US COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), [ArcGIS and ESRI](https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/)

The web app is a one stop site that covers US and Global case situation with Trend and Heat maps. I thought I'd share the app with you and hopefully you would find it helpful as well. Feel free to share it with your family and friends to keep everyone informed with the latest update on Corana virus.
